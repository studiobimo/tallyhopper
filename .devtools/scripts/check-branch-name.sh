# Bot branches are not ours to name. Dependabot's format is fixed --
# dependabot/<ecosystem>/<group>-<hash>, with underscores and an extra path
# segment -- and there is no setting to change it, so every dependency PR would
# fail this check forever and the check would be the thing that gets disabled.
# Nothing is lost: the title and commits a bot writes are Conventional, and the
# title is what becomes the squash commit.
#
# release-please is the same story with a different shape:
# release-please--branches--<target>, plus --components--<name> in a monorepo.
# The double hyphen is its separator and cannot be reconfigured, so it can never
# satisfy the single-hyphen rule below. Its PR title -- chore(main): release
# X.Y.Z -- is Conventional, and that title is what the tag and changelog are cut
# from, so the branch name carries no meaning worth enforcing.
